The goal of this project is to build classifier models that classify news into 5 main categories namely - Business, Culture, News, Opinion and Sport. Dataset was obtained from - https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/ireland-historical-news Dataset contains 1.42 million records with data from 1996 to 2018.
This project is carried out on an Amazon EC2 instance. Steps to create and configure your EC2 instance is provided in a .txt file in the code folder.
